### Abstract

I work on multilingual contextual (sentence) representations. During my Master's thesis and for the titular paper, we explored how static embeddings might be combined with contextual models for well-aligned representations on both sides. We extracted high quality static embeddings from XLM-R and aligned them further. We also continued training the contextual model to improve its cross-lingual alignment, yielding especially large performance increases for sentence retrieval.

### Speaker's bio

My name is Katharina Hämmerl, I am a PhD student at CIS, LMU, co-supervised by Alex Fraser and Jindřich Libovický. My research focuses on multilingual pre-trained language models and sentence representations.
Between autumn 2018 and spring 2021, I obtained my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics from CIS. Before that, I studied English Philology and Computer Science.
