### Abstract

In this talk main techniques for automatic terminology extraction and for automatic detection of translation equivalents of terms will be presented. The talk includes an explanation of the implementation of these techniques into TBXTools, a free tool for terminology extraction. We will explore statistical and linguistic methodologies for terminology extraction. We will also present the implementation of automatic search of translation equivalents of terms in parallel corpora and in statistical machine translation phrase tables.
