### Abstract

Recent years have witnessed a dramatic change of paradigm in phraseology research. Traditional methods have given way to various quantitative, distributional, and computational approaches. Particularly relevant to this talk are three emerging theoretical threads (and their corpus-based complementary methodologies): Construction Grammar and Computational Phraseology (Dobrovol’skij and Piirainen [2018], Fellbaum [2019], Goldberg [2019], Corpas Pastor and Colson [2020]).

Construction Grammar has prompted a profound transformation in the way idiomaticity is understood and viewed. Language is now conceived as an idiomatic continuum of which ‘constructions’ are the building blocks (general phrasal patterns and idioms). In this talk I will take an observational stance toward a corpus-based analysis of ‘insanity’ constructions in English and Spanish. Within a constructionist approach to idiomaticity, special emphasis will be laid on equivalent semantic-functional counterparts, potential mismatches, and other translation issues.
