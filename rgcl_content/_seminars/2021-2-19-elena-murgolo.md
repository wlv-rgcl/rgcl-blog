### Abstract

Have you ever wondered how MT is deployed in an LSP? How do they choose it and test it?
 
Typically, LSPs are not exactly end-users: the real end-users are either professional translators who need to post-edit MT output or non-language professionals who use it in their daily life, sometimes without even realizing it, as in social media.
Language service providers and translation companies find themselves between developers and end-users. But they are also among the most likely to implement costly solutions, such as trained engines, hosting, and subscriptions, to be able to use cutting-edge technology and high-quality products.
LSPs are also probably the owners of the best data to be used during training and creation of new systems.
Implementing this relatively new technology, however, presents new challenges together with the numerous advantages.
In this talk I will summarize the process and give an overview of what an LSP might be facing when approaching MT and PE and our suggestions based on lessons we learned.
