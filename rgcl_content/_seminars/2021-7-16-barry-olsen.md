### Abstract

No one could have foreseen the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the interpreting profession or its accompanying effects on the adoption rate of remote simultaneous interpretation (RSI) all over the world. In a question of weeks, international organizations, national governments, non-governmental organizations, and private corporations were meeting, negotiating, and conducting business online at a scale never seen before, often in multiple languages. But this abrupt adoption of web conferencing with RSI was not entirely smooth or without its challenges. We are now at a stage where we can compile a list of lessons learned during this unprecedented shift in professional practice and turn our sights toward the future to address the new digital world of multilingual communication and interpretation technologyâ€™s place in it.  This presentation will share some of those lessons learned and some thoughts about what the future of RSI may hold.
