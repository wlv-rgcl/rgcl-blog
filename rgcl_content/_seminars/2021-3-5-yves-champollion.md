### Abstract

The author starts with defining the limits and scope of MT as used by translators, as compared with other uses of MT.
Then he briefly gives an overview of the various implementations of MT for translators in the past 25 years, and the typical reactions from translators.
He will review the situation with every generation of MT, discussing MT gains, acceptance, but also pain points and fears. 
The last part will focus on the current state of MT in the translation industry: the strategic aspect of MT for agencies and corporations, the economics of MT, the gain or pain on a translator's side.
