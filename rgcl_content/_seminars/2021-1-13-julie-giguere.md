### Abstract

Although Artificial Intelligence development in machine translation is leading to lower prices, higher efficiency and increasing speed of translation for businesses, there remains much to be done to create a robust system that covers all known languages and all specialised subject areas with the same level of usage quality. This is why having a data quality management system is key to utilising the technology safely. We like the analogy of “coaching” the machine . This is because NMT are "intelligent" machines and they will learn not just from the translation that the human translator produced, but also from other feedback. NMT engines learn from bilingual and monolingual data, the goal is to learn from the “segment + its post edit” pair and induce the model to better translate the next input segment. This means that, in time, the task of the linguist will involve less fixing of grammatical errors, and more checking whether the translation is correct or not, making the process of post-editor more enjoyable. We will look at the upstream and downstream tasks that the human editor can perform to improve the machine output and the mechanism of the intelligent machine.
