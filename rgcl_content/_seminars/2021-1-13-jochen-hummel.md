### Abstract

For decades the basic architecture of Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) has been left unchanged; and with it the industry's business model. The advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) have now made CAT tools as we know them obsolete. For more and more projects NMT is achieving “human parity”. That changes everything. Different actors using innovative tools in re-engineered workflows demand new business models, but also offer opportunities for innovative service providers.
