### Abstract

This talk will revolve around language technologies applied to interpreting. Nowadays there is a pressing need to develop interpreting-related technologies, with practitioners and other end-users increasingly calling for tools tailored to their needs and their new interpreting scenarios. With the advent of new technology, interpreters can work remotely, deliver interpreting in different modes and contexts, on many devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.), and even manage bookings and invoice clients with ease. But interpreting as a human activity has resisted complete automation for various reasons, such as fear, unawareness, communication complexities, lack of dedicated tools, etc.
 
Several computer-assisted interpreting tools and resources for interpreters have been developed, mainly terminology management tools, corpora, and note-taking applications, but they are rather modest in terms of the support they provide. In the same vein, and despite the pressing need to aiding in multilingual mediation, machine interpreting is still under development, with the exception of a few success stories so far.
 
In this talk, I will present recent R&D projects on interpreting technologies in action. The first one is a speech-to-text system for automating communication of English and Arabic speaking patients in Spanish hospital triage scenarios at A&E services (in progress). The second one is already close to completion. It comprises a suite of NLP-enhanced tools and resources for interpreters and trainees, including but not limited to, terminology tools, corpora building and processing, automatic glossary building, automatic speech recognition and training tools. Final discussion will go back to the two idioms blended in the title of this talkâ€¦
