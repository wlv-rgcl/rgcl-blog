### Abstract

The use of translation memory tools is now fairly well embedded within the profession. While many translators are obliged to use one or other well-known system, others who are able to choose for themselves are perhaps confused by the sheer choice of systems that are available. In this talk I will demonstrate Memsource, Wordfast and Matecat and attempt to answer the following two questions: 1) to what extent does a free tool provide you with the functions that are needed to work at a professional level and 2) what are the strengths and weaknesses of each of these three systems?
