> Digital Humanities, aka Cultural Analytics, is the computational study of the Humanities in a way that advanced Humanities research in such disciplines as history, literature, film, and geography. Commonly used methods are Natural Language Processing, Network Analysis, and Visualisation. Computational methods for the Humanities promise a revolution in Humanities research as they work hand in hand with domain experts who carry out the close readings. The Digital Humanities seminar series will give the students and staff the opportunity to listen to talks by, and engage with, leading figures in humanities computing from across the spectrum.
