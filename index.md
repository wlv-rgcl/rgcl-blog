<p>
<b>Our mission</b>
<br />
The mission of the Research Group is to produce world-leading research, to offer first-class research supervision and postgraduate teaching in the interdisciplinary areas of information and language processing, and to deliver cutting-edge practical (including commercial) applications with far-reaching societal impact based on its research output.

<b>Join our journey</b>
<br />
RGCL is pursuing active research in many areas including anaphora resolution, automatic summarization, terminology extraction, corpus development and exploitation, information extraction, named entity recognition, question answering, multiple choice questions, machine translation and multilingual applications. 
<br />
<br />
In addition to these topics, the members of the team have their own particular research interests. Please visit the <a href="https://www.wlv.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/riilp---research-institute-of-information-and-language-processing/research-group-in-computational-linguistics/staff-at-rgcl/" target="_blank"> People page</a> to find out more about these interests. In order to pursue successful research in these areas the members of the Research Group have a very strong background in Computer Science being able to program in a wide range of programming languages such as Python, C, C#, Java, Perl, PHP and in areas such as database and XML technologies, and web applications.
<br />
<br />
Most of the research is carried out as part of externally funded projects. If you are interested you can find out more about our current and past projects. Many of the research topics are pursued in collaboration with our <a href="https://www.wlv.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/riilp---research-institute-of-information-and-language-processing/research-group-in-computational-linguistics/phd-students/" target="_blank">PhD students</a>.
