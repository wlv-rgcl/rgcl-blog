<p>The research group is offering a Master of Arts in Computational Linguistics (MA CompLing). The duration of study is one year full time, or between two and four years part time.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s it all about?</strong></p>
<p>Are you interested in working with cutting-edge technology at the forefront of language processing?</p>
<p>MA Computational Linguistics is a course run by a leading research group at the University of Wolverhampton. As a Masters student on this course, you will be part of our Research Institute of Information and Language Processing (RIILP), an independent, research-driven University unit specialising in Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Computational Linguistics (sometimes called Natural Language Processing) is the use of computers to study language. On the course, you will be able to study:<br />
• How to use Python and the well-established NLTK library to process natural language texts;<br />
• How to analyse real language usage;<br />
• How to automatically translate text using computer programs;<br />
• The use of computers to study features of language;<br />
• Translation tools such as translation memory systems;<br />
• Computer techniques for automatically classifying natural language texts;<br />
• Understand how Siri, Amazon Echo and Google Home etc. work;<br />
• How to design an experiment that will thoroughly test your research questions.</p>
<p>You will be mentored through this programme by experienced and leading academics from the field. Join our research group today to become part of this team of leading researchers and academics and create your path to a career in computers and language!</p>
