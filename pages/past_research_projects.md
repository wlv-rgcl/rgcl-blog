<p><strong>EXPERT:        </strong>EXPERT (EXPloiting Empirical appRoaches to Translation) aims to train young researchers, namely Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) and Experienced Researchers (ERs), to promote the research, development and use of hybrid language translation technologies. The overall objective of EXPERT is to provide innovative research and training in the field of Translation memory and Machine Translation Technologies to 15 Marie Curie Fellows.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.clg.wlv.ac.uk/projects/CAST/index.php"><strong>CAST</strong></a><strong>:                         </strong>The main objective of this project was the research and development of a user-oriented computer-aided summarisation tool. The project also proposed new methods for automatic summarisation and evaluation of automatic summarisation methods. The construction of a corpus with the most important sentences marked and other information useful for summarisation annotated will be an additional product of the project.</p>
