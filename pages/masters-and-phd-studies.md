<a href="https://em-tti.eu/"><strong>European Master’s Technology for Translation and Interpreting (EM TTI)</strong></a></p>
<p>This MA addresses the need for a new generation of translators and interpreters through a programme of outstanding academic quality, in line with the Erasmus+ ethos of building a stronger workforce with the breadth of skills and perspectives needed to stimulate developments in the field. EM TTI will produce specialists in translation and interpreting who are up-to-date with the latest applications which support their daily work, as well as future developers of such applications.</p>
<p>A strong consortium of the <a href="https://www.wlv.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Wolverhampton, UK</a> (the co-ordinator); <a href="https://www.uma.es/?set_language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Malaga, Spain</a>; <a href="https://www.nbu.bg/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Bulgarian University, Bulgaria;</a> and and <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en">Ghent University, Belgium</a>; embodies the aim to deliver a cohesive, integrated European-wide programme which will be the first of its kind worldwide. The synergy between these three Higher Education institutions, who are known for their seminal contributions in the computational aspects of language study, as well as technology of translation and interpreting, will ensure that students have access to leading academics and best practices across the field. The associate partners of the programme are leading companies, user organisations, and non-EC universities who further enhance this student-centred and market-orientated programme with a vision of delivering educational quality and vocational skills to maximise the students’ career potential,  complementing the quality and integrity of the programme.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 year masters programme</li>
<li>Students have to obtain 120 ECTS: 60 ECTS from taught modules and 60 ECTS from dissertation</li>
<li>Study in first year at one of the partner universities and in the second year at another one</li>
<li>Two obligatory one month placements at associated partners, one each year; at least one of the placement is at a company</li>
<li>Double degree</li>
<li>English is the main language of teaching, but given the nature of the programme, knowledge of additional languages is required</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What does a Masters or PhD involve?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you choose to apply for one of our Masters (MA) programmes or a PhD programme will largely depend on the level of support or independence you would like to have in following your research interests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Masters courses provide a more structured programme, largely composed of taught modules with a dissertation at the end. Students will work towards completing 180 credits in total, 60 credits of which is a dissertation, and teaching is through a mixture of lectures and lab work. The Masters courses would be particularly suitable for students who have a broad interest in the areas that the Masters covers and who would like to develop their knowledge of multiple aspects of Computational Linguistics and Corpus Linguistics. They also provide a greater level of support and contact time for students who wish to pursue a postgraduate degree, but don&#8217;t yet feel ready for the level of independent study required by a PhD programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our PhD course involves three to four years full-time research (or seven to eight part-time) into a specific area, usually determined by the student. Students will complete a thesis of up to 45,000 words if the research includes implementation of programs and experiments, or up to 90,000 words for more theoretical research. (These figures exclude essential ancillary data). The thesis is also expected to make an original contribution to the field. At the end of the degree, students defend their thesis in a <em>viva voce</em> examination, where they discuss their research with two examiners. A PhD programme is more suited to students who already have a clear research interest, and study is generally self-directed. Students will meet with supervisors on a regular basis to discuss their work and progress, but most of their research is carried out independently.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why study a Masters or PhD programme?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Completing a postgraduate degree is an excellent way of developing your knowledge and expertise in a particular field, as well as distinguishing you from other graduates who have only completed an undergraduate degree. Postgraduate programmes normally focus on a much more specific area than undergraduate courses, enabling you to enhance your abilities and understanding further, as well as allowing you to complete more independent project work. Completing a Masters dissertation or PhD thesis indicates that you are adept in areas such as problem solving, time management and project management, and it will also often enable you to work on innovative and cutting-edge projects. PhD research in particular must make an original contribution to the field, meaning that you are working at the forefront of your discipline and often with experts in your area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of career opportunities, Computational Linguistics is a thriving field; companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and IBM are all active recruiters of graduates with degrees in this area. Aside from industrial career options, a PhD qualification is also essential for anyone considering work in academia and further research.</p>
