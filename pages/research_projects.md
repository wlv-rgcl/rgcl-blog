The amount of text available in electronic format and available on the internet is growing exponentially and much of this information has to be translated or interpreted. As a result, there is a pressing need for a new generation of translators and interpreters who rely less on traditional methods and instead benefit from a range of time- and labour-efficient technological tools. To address the growing demand for such professional translators and interpreters, **MA Technology for Translation and Interpreting (MA TTI)** will produce specialists in translation and interpreting who are up-to-date with the latest applications which support their daily work.

**MA Technology for Translation and Interpreting&nbsp;** addresses the need for a new generation of translators and interpreters through a programme of outstanding academic quality, in line with the Erasmus+ ethos of building a stronger workforce with the breadth of skills and perspectives needed to stimulate developments in the field. The offer of scholarships will drive competition for places and ensure candidates of the highest calibre are selected.

A strong consortium of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wlv.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Wolverhampton, UK</a>&nbsp;(Coordinator);&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uma.es/?set_language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Malaga, Spain</a>; <a href="https://www.nbu.bg/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Bulgarian University, Bulgaria</a>; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ugent.be/en">Ghent University, Belgium</a>, embodies the aim to deliver a cohesive, integrated European-wide programme which will be the first of its kind worldwide. The synergy between these three Higher Education institutions, who are known for their seminal contributions in the computational aspects of language study, as well as technology of translation and interpreting, will ensure that students have access to leading academics and best practices across the field. The associated partners of the programme are leading companies, user organisations, and non-EC universities who further enhance this student-centred and market-orientated programme with a vision of delivering educational quality and vocational skills to maximise the studentsâ€™ career potential,&nbsp; complementing the quality and integrity of the programme.&nbsp;

### <span class="icon fa-solid fa-bookmark"></span> Cultural Analytics for the Arabic and Islamic Heritage

**PI: Dr Emad Mohamed**

The field of Cultural Analytics seeks to use advanced technology (Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Network Analysis among other things to get better insights into human culture.
This includes history, art, and human creativity. 
The project seeks to digitize, annotate, and create computational tools for the Arabic press from its inception until circa 1950.
