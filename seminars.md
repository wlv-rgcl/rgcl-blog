					<h3>Technologies for Translation and Interpreting: Challenges and Latest Developments</h3>
				</header>
        <p>
        <u>Seminar Lead</u>: Prof Ruslan Mitkov
        </p>
				<p>
        This vibrant seminar series hosts leading scholars and CEOs of companies to report on their work and vision related to the technology for translators and interpreters covering among other topics translation and interpreting tools and resources and Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence solutions. 
        The seminar series has both strong research and industrial foci and as such serves not only as a forum showcasing latest research, professional practices, software and business developments but also bridging the gap between academia and the industry.

					<h3>Digital Humanities</h3>
				</header>
        <p>
        <u>Seminar Lead</u>: Dr Tharindu Ranasinghe &amp; Dr Emma Franklin
        </p>
        <p>
        Digital Humanities, aka Cultural Analytics, is the computational study of the Humanities in a way that advanced Humanities research in such disciplines as history, literature, film, and geography.
        Commonly used methods are Natural Language Processing, Network Analysis, and Visualisation.
        Computational methods for the Humanities promise a revolution in Humanities research as they work hand in hand with domain experts who carry out the close readings.
        The Digital Humanities seminar series will give the students and staff the opportunity to listen to talks by, and engage with, leading figures in humanities computing from across the spectrum.
