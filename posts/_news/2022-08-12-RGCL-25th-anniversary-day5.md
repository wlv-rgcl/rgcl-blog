First-class research and teaching are only possible with first-class administrative support. 
RGCL is proud to say that its admin team staff are not only brilliant, efficient, positive, helpful and adaptable in all situations, but are in fact award-winning!

Nominated for their outstanding team performance in a range of collaborations, the admin staff members Amanda Bloore, April Harper, Suman Hira, Kate Wilson and Emma Franklin were awarded the Vice Chancellor’s Excellence in Partnership award as part of the Staff Excellence 2021 awards evening.

The award nominators wrote:
> “This team has done extraordinary work in partnerships to ensure that we have the infrastructure, systems, and processes in place to grow our research activity and outcomes. Their work is vital for supporting our scholars, visitors, and postgraduate students, which is key to attracting funding and self-funded students. Collectively, they manage multi-million-pound projects with partners from over 20 countries.

> The team has also initiated, developed, and maintained strong relationships with units such as Finance, HR, Bidding Support Team, RPU, ITS, Student Records, Registry, STAR office, Visa and CAS team, Admissions, and FSE.

> Additionally, the team has formed a way of working that allows easy handover and collaborative work, and ensured that a sense of community has continued off campus. Throughout the past year their infamous ‘cake Wednesdays’ moved online, there was bingo at Christmas, and they have organised picnics in the park for staff and students.

On winning the VC award, Operations Manager and Head of the RGCL admin team, Dr Amanda Bloore, said:
> “It is an honour to lead such a pro-active and hard-working admin team. Winning the 'Excellence in Partnerships VC Award' in 2021 was an unexpected recognition of the dedication and support that the admin team provided RIILP students and staff throughout the pandemic, something that they continue to provide. We are always willing to help, and always have cake to offer anyone who pops by!"

RGCL cannot stress enough how vital the admin team is to the success of the Group, whether it’s through processing important forms and documentation, guiding staff and students, helping our visitors, working closely with other University departments, organising events, or supporting our teaching and projects. 
They’re simply the best!
