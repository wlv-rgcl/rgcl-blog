In 2003, after publishing our work in multiple-choice question generation in
the very first [BEA workshop](https://aclanthology.org/events/ws-2003/#w03-02), the director of the Centre for Innovation at NBME
came to us (see our [NBME highlight](https://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/news/2022-08-18-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day9/)) with the statement: “I believe that in the
future, all test questions will be generated automatically by computers”. At
that time, it was a very bold, and head-scratching, statement. Would you want
to test humans using questions generated by machines? It is now a reality: the
items of Duolingo English Test (an English test that is now used by thousands
of Universities) are generated automatically, and of course, reviewed by human
experts (see page 13,
[https://duolingo-papers.s3.amazonaws.com/other/det-technical-manual-current.pdf](https://duolingo-papers.s3.amazonaws.com/other/det-technical-manual-current.pdf)).

In 2004, as Google Translate was about two years from being published, Ted
Marshall, an entrepreneur from
[Translution](https://www.translutionsoftware.com/), came to RGCL with an idea:
what if you can send an email in English to a Romanian customer, and they can
read it in their own language? What if such emails are translated with proper
terminology? What do we need to make these come true? RGCL then identified
several important problems for machine translations back then, chief among them
is the problem of translating Named Entities (Google Translate still has some
problems with this now). RGCL then implemented a set of NE recognisers and
part-of-speech taggers for multiple languages to help Translution solve the
problems. It was slightly ahead of its time, as now everything, not only
emails, can be automatically translated on the fly.

In 2008, Nokia was still the king of mobile phone market; the iPhone 2G had just
been introduced; Siri was two years from being released; and RGCL was involved
in a project named [QALL-ME](http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/projects/QALL-ME/), an EU-FP6 project which aimed at the realization of
a shared and distributed infrastructure for Question Answering (QA) systems on
mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones). Questions are formulated by the users in
free natural language input, and the system returns the actual sequence of
words which constitutes the answer from a collection of information sources. Is
that what Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant are doing, I hear
you ask? Yes, it is, and yes, it was back in 2008 that RGCL was also working on
them. Slightly too soon, if you ask us. 

Moving forward, RGCL has continued to produce avant-garde and cutting-edge
research based on ideas that were ahead of their time. Such examples are our
innovative research on [computer-aided summarisation](http://www.clg.wlv.ac.uk/projects/CAST/index.php); the use of NLP methodology
to assist people with autism (see our recent highlights on [FIRST](https://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/news/2022-08-10-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day3/) and [AUTOR](https://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/news/2022-08-11-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day4/));
award-winning [quality estimation tools](https://tharindu.co.uk/TransQuest/) for machine translation; and our leading
and seminal work on anaphora resolution.
