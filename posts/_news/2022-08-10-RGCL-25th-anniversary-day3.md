Between the years of 2011 and 2014, RGCL coordinated an EC FP7-ICT project
worth more than €2.5 million called *[FIRST](http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/projects/FIRST/)* (a Flexible Interactive Reading
Support Tool). Researchers on the FIRST project developed innovative language
technology to simplify documents for people with Autism Spectrum Disorders
(ASD), on the basis that people with ASD can have problems when reading such as
difficulty understanding complex instructions, misinterpreting literal
meanings, or being confused by uncommon words, figures of speech and lack of
precision. The project, which had six international and two UK partners, was a
resounding success and brought half a million euros of EC funding to the
University of Wolverhampton.

RGCL researcher of 24 years, Dr Richard Evans, writes:

  > “The goal of the project was to develop language technologies to assist carers and relatives of people on the autism spectrum to make the information locked in written documents more accessible for these users. It brought together staff from nine organisations across Europe, including universities, software companies, healthcare service providers, NGOs, and charities. I’d say this is the project that most closely reflects my original motivation to enter the NLP research area.  
  >  
  >It was the first time that we had a chance to see the reactions of real end users and their carers (people who were far removed from the ivory tower) to NLP software that we had collectively developed. It was an invaluable learning experience. Despite the fact that their reactions were not always positive, they were always helpful. Those stakeholders often expressed their happiness at being involved in a genuine co-production between academia, healthcare service providers, NGOs, and software companies, a co-production in which their comments were always heard and active steps were taken to remedy their complaints.  
  >  
  > RGCL’s recent acquisition of an eye tracker means that it is now better able to determine the needs of people with reading comprehension difficulties and to develop NLP methods to meet those needs.”

The software developed In the FIRST project was called *OpenBook*, and was demonstrated by Richard Evans at a launch event in the final year of the project.

Thank you, Richard, for your many years of dedication and invaluable service to the Research Group and the University!
