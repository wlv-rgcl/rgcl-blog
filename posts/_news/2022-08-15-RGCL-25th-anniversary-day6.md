RGCL has been the hub of a number of pioneering and innovative research
projects over the past 25 years, but one that particularly stands out for its
uniqueness and theoretical advancement is the AHRC-funded Disambiguation of
Verbs by Collocation (DVC) project, which ran from 2012 to 2015.

*Prof Patrick Hanks, the head and lead lexicographer of the DVC project (2012-2015)*

Prof Patrick Hanks, eminent lexicographer and onomastician and the former
Editor-in-Chief of Oxford English Dictionaries – [amongst others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Hanks) – spearheaded
this groundbreaking experiment in corpus lexicography, which was based on the
culmination of his decades of research and industry experience and,
specifically, his Theory of Norms and Exploitations (TNE). TNE formed the basis
of the novel technique of lexical analysis used in the project, which Hanks
terms Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA), and which has since been applied and
adapted to a wide range of problems across a number of linguistic fields.

On the DVC project, computational linguists, educators, lexicographers, and
junior annotators came together to learn and later train others in the CPA
technique, and to develop an online tool that would eventually form the Pattern
Dictionary of English Verbs (PDEV). Since the start of the project, almost
1,700 English verbs have been analysed by corpus lexicographers following
Hanks’ instruction, and using the purpose-built shallow ontology of around 250
semantic types. The tool is freely available to use at [https://pdev.org.uk/](https://pdev.org.uk/).

The DVC project was a resounding success in terms of research done and
conclusions reached. Its researchers developed new insights into the nature of
meaning in language and created new tools for lexical analysis and
lexicography. They demonstrated, by painstaking analysis of nearly 463,000
corpus lines from the British National Corpus, that the meaning of clauses and
sentences depends in large part on collocational patterns of word use, not
merely on a simple concatenation of lexical items, each one havening a distinct
meaning. As Prof Hanks liked to reiterate, language is not a Lego set!

More detailed information on the DVC project is given below, taken from the project page archives.

### DVC: Disambiguation of Verbs by Collocation

#### Team members:  
* Prof. Ruslan Mitkov (PI) 
* Prof. Patrick Hanks (Co-I) 
* Dr Ismail El Maarouf (RA) 
* Ms Jane Bradbury (RA, 2012-14) 
* Dr Sara Moze (RA 2014-15) 
* Emma Franklin (Junior annotator, 2013-15) 

#### Objectives of the DVC project:

To discover, through corpus pattern analysis, the characteristic patterns of use for English verbs and to link meanings to each pattern.  
To build a pattern dictionary, which will contain patterns for 3000 English verbs  
To test the hypothesis that, whereas words are very ambiguous, patterns are mostly unambiguous  
To set up links between patterns and a tagged corpus  
To build an empirically well-founded ontology of semantic types  
To carry out an in-depth analysis of 100 verbs, with rich pattern descriptions, showing internal structure, alternations, and relevant dependencies  
To develop an original theory of the relationship between word meaning and word use

#### Results:

DVC results have been published on line, in a user-friendly version
at [www.pdev.org.uk](www.pdev.org.uk), along with the associated empirically well-founded shallow
ontology of 220 semantic types, which was developed in the course of the
project, being applied to nouns for the purpose of verb sense disambiguation. A
semantic type represents an intrinsic property of each lexical item. The CPA
ontology of semantic types is supplemented in relevant contexts by contextually
assigned roles and semantic prosody. 

The DVC project has shown that a verb pattern consists of a combination of
collocations (lexical sets) and syntagmatics (clause roles, a.k.a. arguments).
Each pattern is used repeatedly an infinite number of times, with lexical
variations, in everyday usage. But in addition, the project has shed light on
the creative use of language. It has been shown that normal, conventional
patterns of word use are exploited in various ways. The project discovered
evidence for three basic types of exploitation of normal usage patterns:
figurative uses such as metaphors, metonymy, and similes; anomalous arguments;
and syntactic exploitations. Exploitations are used for rhetorical effect, but
also to create meanings expressing new and unfamiliar situations. The evidence
that we have analysed suggests that exploitations are rule-governed – but
governed by a quite different set of rules from those that govern syntactic
well-formedness. Analysis of exploitation rules has been earmarked as a topic
for a future research project. 

After a preliminary study, the project rejected generative models of grammar as
an analytical basis and instead adopted SPOCA, a ‘slot-and-filler’ Hallidayan
model of Functional Grammar, which emphasizes the importance of clause roles
[Subject, Predicator, Object, Complement, Adverbial] in the everyday use of
natural language to create meanings. Future research will relate this model to
the Dependency Grammars used in Computational Linguistics. Relevant
‘subargumental’ cues were identified where necessary: for example the
importance of the presence or absence of (a particular class of) determiner in
establishing the meaning of the verb ‘take’ with ‘place’ as direct object, as
in take place vs. take one’s place vs. take someone else’s place vs. take first
place. 

The project proceeded verb by verb, in contrast to FrameNet, which proceeds
frame by frame. This means that, when DVC declares a verb entry as complete,
all normal patterns of use have been identified. The patterns are contrastive:
that is, each pattern has a distinct implicature or meaning, which can be used
to predict the meaning of sentences in previously unseen texts. 

Corpus evidence for 1729 verbs was studied in detail. Typically, 250 corpus
lines were analysed for each verb, insofar as that number of corpus lines was
available. 

BNC errors in word-class assignment (i.e. uses that were not verbs at all
despite being (wrongly) classified as such in BNC) were rejected. 

Work on DVC continues. In addition to completing the analysis of verbs, there
is a need for corpus pattern analysis of nouns and adjectives. There is also a
need to create more precise links between the patterns and a parsed corpus,
which could in itself contribute to improvements in parsing technology. All of
these will be the subject of future research proposals. 

In 2013, MIT Press published Professor Hanks’s monograph describing his new
theory of linguistic behaviour under the title Lexical Analysis: Norms and
Exploitations. For other publications by members of the DVC group, see below.

#### The DVC team:
- organized an international NLP challenge hosted at the SemEval 2015 competition. 
- organized an international workshop on Corpus Pattern Analysis in Wolverhampton (2013) 
- converted PDEV to a Linguistic Linked Data resource in order to facilitate its use in Semantic Web and NLP applications. 
- created a preliminary network of semantic strings for automatic verb class discovery. 
- created verb groups according to the prototypical meaning of the verb and developed a semantic tagger based on automatic ontology population techniques. 
- developed a training module integrated in the SketchEngine, which allows trainees to perform corpus analysis and be automatically assessed by the system. 
- developed a clustering module integrated in the SketchEngine, which sorts lines according to their similarity. 
- created a Bootstrapping module integrated in the SketchEngine, which guesses the pattern number of an untagged line, based on the user’s tagging history. 
- developed a fully synchronized lightweight lexicographical interface for pattern dictionaries, which allows the lexicographer to list and sort verbs according to various properties, create patterns for a verb and share the work with other users, annotate lines in the BNC with pattern numbers that link back to the dictionary, easily manually renumber patterns, navigate the ontology by semantic type or by nouns using an automatically populated ontology as well as a list of manually created suggestions, extract verbs and patterns which share common features such as making use of a specific semantic type, easily export data, and statistics. This editor has also been tested on Italian and is being used by colleagues.
