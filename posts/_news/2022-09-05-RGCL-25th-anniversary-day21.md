The field of Computational Linguistics moves rapidly, perhaps too rapidly for
traditional publishing methods. Nonetheless, after the huge success of the
[first edition](https://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/news/2022-09-02-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day20/) of the *Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics* in 2003, it
went without saying that a second edition should follow. Fast forward 19 years,
and this year, in 2022, the significantly updated and revised second edition
was finally published in hardback by OUP.

Now expanded to have four parts, and with contributions from 71 leading names
at institutions ranging from Harvard, Cornell, and – of course – the University
of Wolverhampton, this second edition is a modernised study companion for
scholars and students of all levels in the fields of Computational Linguistics
and Natural Language Processing.

The volume has a total of 50 chapters, 17 of them brand new and all 50
significantly revised, and covers a range of cutting-edge methods and
applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP), including Deep Learning,
Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Text Simplification, and Biomedical
Computational Linguistics. The final chapter, Recent Developments in Natural
Language Processing, shines a light of some of the most recent and pressing
uses of NLP, including chatbots, computer vision, crowdsourced data, and NLP
for the benefit of society.

This new edition of the Handbook also features a comprehensive and
much-extended reference glossary of almost 900 Computational Linguistics terms,
carefully compiled by RGCL’s Professor Patrick Hanks (former Editor-in-Chief of
Oxford English Dictionaries) and Dr Emma Franklin.

Professor Mitkov, Director of the Research Institute of Information and
Language Processing, and Head of RGCL, said:
> “I am very proud to share the news of the publication of the second and
> substantially revised edition of the Oxford Handbook of Computational
> Linguistics. As Prof Dan Jurafsky from Stanford University (one of the
> leading lights of the field) said, ‘This volume will define the field for
> another decade’. When I was designing the Handbook and its contents, I made
> sure through a tightly controlled editing process that not only the most
> important and latest topics are covered but that the volume is a coherent
> whole by ensuring cross-references across all chapters. I am delighted that
> colleagues and students will have access to this new valuable resource; I am
> particularly happy for the students. I would very much like to acknowledge
> the role my colleague Dr Emma Franklin who assisted me in the production at
> every stage: without her expert help, this challenging project would have
> been significantly delayed.”
