Every year, the University of Wolverhampton awards 10 research fellowships to support projects led by researchers who obtained their PhD in the last 5 years. The initiative is called [ERAS – Early Research Award Scheme](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/research/the-doctoral-college/early-researcher-award-scheme-eras/) and provides a budget of up to 5,000 pounds to each project. The program has existed since 2016 and applications are selective on a competitive basis.

Marcos Zampieri, a member of RGCL and RIILP, was selected to be part of the 2018-2019 cohort of ERAS fellows with a project entitled “*Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media*”. The project deals with the application of computational methods to identify offensive and aggressive language and hate speech in social media. The funding will support the annotation of a large offensive language dataset that will be used in a [SemEval 2019 task](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20011).
