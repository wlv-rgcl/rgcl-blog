Not many people can say they have three(!) honorary degrees, but Prof Ruslan
Mitkov, the Head of RGCL and Director of RIILP, is soon to become a member of
this very exclusive club. In October, Prof Mitkov will receive his third
prestigious *Honoris Causa* award in recognition of his lifetime of outstanding
professional and research achievements and his service to the Computational
Linguistics research community.

On the announcement of this third honorary degree, Prof Mitkov commented:
> “I am not a fan of blue-skies research. What I have always advocated is
> research that helps society; research should make our lives better and more
> accessible and should assist people in their work. It should make things
> easier and should save people time and money. That has always been my mission
> in my work in Natural Language Processing.”
