The *EXPERT* (EXPloiting Empirical appRoaches to Translation) project ran from
2012 to 2016 and, thanks to the coordinating staff members in RGCL, brought
more than €800,000 to the University. The aim of the project was to train young
researchers, namely Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) and Experienced Researchers
(ERs), and to promote the research, development and use of hybrid language
translation technologies. EXPERT’s main objective was to provide innovative
research and training in the field of Translation memory and Machine
Translation Technologies to 16 Marie Curie Fellows. The project appointed 12
PhD students and six postdoctoral researchers to work on a variety of project
related to hybrid language translation technologies ranging from investigating
the requirements of users and collection of data, to the development of hybrid
methods and new evaluation metrics.

The project was funded to the tune of €4million under the FP7 Marie Curie ITN
scheme, coordinated by RGCL’s Constantin Orasan and delivered by a consortium
featuring six academic partners: University of Wolverhampton, UK; University of
Malaga, Spain; University of Sheffield, UK; Saarland University, Germany;
Dublin City University, Ireland and University of Amsterdam, Netherlands, as
well as three industrial partners: Pangeanic, Spain; Translated, Italy; and
Hermes, Spain. In addition, the consortium benefitted from the contribution of
four associated partners: WordFast, France; Etrad, Argentina; Unbabel,
Portugal; and DFKI, Germany.

The individual projects carried out by the EXPERT fellows together with their
supervisors produced research that advanced the state of the art related to
data-driven and hybrid machine translation. The project overlapped with the
period when the field of machine translation was making the transition from
statistical machine translation to neural machine translation. The researchers
involved in the EXPERT project made great contributions to this newly emerged
paradigm, and we are especially grateful to Constantin Orasan for his
originality, dedication, hard work and enthusiasm which were vital to the
project’s success.
