Over the last 25 years, RGCL has provided support and supervision to more than
35 PhD students. The progression of our students and staff has always been at
the core of RGCL, with several PhD students subsequently going on to work with
the Group for many years. Prof Constantin Orasan, who completed his PhD in
2006, was employed by RGCL and went on to be a Reader in Computational
Linguistics and the Deputy Head of the Research Group (he is now a Professor at
the University of Surrey). Dr Le An Ha, who completed his PhD with the Group in
2007, is now employed here as a Senior Lecturer and has worked on many
prestigious projects, including our ongoing NBME collaboration. Dr Richard
Evans worked as a Research Associate with the Group for many years before
completing his PhD in 2019. Richard is currently a Senior Lecturer in RGCL.
Shiva Taslimipoor and Victoria Yaneva, both of whom completed their PhDs with
RGCL, also went on to work in academic roles here and now hold prestigious
titles elsewhere. There are too many successful former PhD students of ours to
mention!

With 13 students currently undertaking their PhD with RGCL, three of whom are
aiming to submit their theses by the end of the year, the Group continues to
show its deep commitment to producing a steady turnout of the highest quality
research students.
