Today’s highlight goes all the way back to the early 2000s, when RGCL secured
its first ESRC grant for the newsworthy BiRD project (“An automatic system to
Build Resource Databases for researchers”). The aim of BiRD was to process
archives of mailing lists and use information extraction to populate a database
with information about Natural Language Processing resources. This was made
available for researchers, students, lecturers, project managers, and even
industrial companies and funding agencies. It landed RGCL in the news:

*The BiRD project was picked up by the press. Pictured are RGCL members Constantin Orasan, Le An Ha, Catalina Barbu, Ruslan Mitkov, and Richard Evans*

Ruslan Mitkov and Constantin Orasan were instrumental in the bid-writing
process, while Richard Evans and Viktor Pekar (pictured below) undertook the
research on the project.

The BiRD project was crucial in raising the visibility and the profile of the
Group in its early days, and several of the key members are still part of the
Research Group today.
