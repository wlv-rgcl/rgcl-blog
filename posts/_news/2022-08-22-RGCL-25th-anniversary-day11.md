For today’s anniversary highlight we look back to the ambitious European
TELL-ME project (*Towards European Language Learning for Medical Professionals*),
coordinated by RGCL on behalf of the University of Wolverhampton.

This project was carried out back in 2012, when the UK was still a fully
committed EU member! A key European Union (EU) priority is to create ways of
aiding citizens’ mobility. Promoting easy access to high-quality healthcare and
enhancing cross-border healthcare are priorities in the European Parliament.
With all the benefits of this mobility, it is vital to keep a high standard of
medical treatment, and crucial to providing this level of treatment is
high-quality doctor-patient communication. Studies show that if patients
misunderstand health-related issues, serious implications can result as well as
increased healthcare costs. The problem is greater when there is a language
barrier. This must be removed to ensure more effective health services. 

TELL-ME aimed to do this by developing materials to teach vocationally-specific
language to healthcare professionals and help them to communicate at work. To
do this a consortium of three universities and four varied medical operations,
all involved with training, were carefully assembled. 

The languages targeted by the project, English, Spanish and German, are among
the five most spoken languages in Europe, so patients from one EU country
seeking medical treatment in another will probably understand one of them. So
our project provided self-study material for medical English, Spanish and
German intended specifically for medics. The package involved a range of
products including work-related language exercises, self-assessment tools and
an interactive dictionary of key vocabulary and concepts. These have been
tested out on trainees by the medical partners and disseminated to key national
medical policy makers.

The project was not all plain sailing. At that time the NHS West Midlands
Strategic Health Authority was going through a transformation plan worth
billions of pounds, and as a result, could not dedicate resources to this
project. Some challenges among the partners also appeared, due to the fact that
everybody wanted to deliver the best project. In the end, despite those
setbacks, the project was successfully delivered. This is an example of the
materials developed by the project:

RGCL’s Dr Le An Ha said:
