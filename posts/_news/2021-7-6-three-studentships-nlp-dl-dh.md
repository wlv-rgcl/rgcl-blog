**** Closing date 19 July 2021 ****

The Research Group in Computational Linguistics (<http://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk>) at the Research Institute of Information and Language Processing of the University of Wolverhampton invites applications

for three PhD studentships with the prospective PhD students working on the following topics: (i) Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL) in Computational History studies, (ii) NLP and DL in Computational Literature studies and (iii) NLP and DL in Computational Film Studies.

These are 3-year funded bursaries which will include a stipend towards living expenses (£15,609 per year) with the tuition fees and the research fees included.

Applicants will submit PhD research proposals not exceeding 2,000 words. The applicants are invited to propose an original computational history study, computational literature study or computational film study where NLP and DL techniques are employed.

*Prerequisites*

A successful applicant must have a good honours degree or equivalent in Computer Science, Computational Linguistics, Digital Humanities or Linguistics, with good programming skills, and knowledge of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.

*Application procedure*

Applications must include:

- Research proposal not exceeding 2,000 words (see above)
- A curriculum vitae listing degrees awarded, courses covered and marks obtained, publications, relevant experience and names of two referees who could be contacted for a reference
- Cover letter with statement of research interests, outlining why you are interested in this PhD position/topic, how you plan to approach the research task and why you consider your experience is relevant.

Schedule

The application deadline is 19 July 2021. The short-listed candidates will be notified by email by 20 July 2021 and interviewed via Zoom on 21 or 22 July 2021. The starting date of the PhD position is 1 September 2021 or any time as soon as possible after that.

Established by Prof Mitkov in 1998, the research group in Computational Linguistics delivers cutting-edge research in a number of NLP areas. The results from the UK research assessment exercises confirm the research group in Computational Linguistics as one of the top performers in UK and international research with its research assessed as ‘internationally leading, internationally excellent and internationally recognised’.

The PhD students will be members of the newly established Responsible Digital Humanities Research Lab which is part of the Research Group of Computational Linguistics.

Applications should be sent by email to Prof Dr Ruslan Mitkov, 
Director of Research Institute of Information and Language Processing,
University of Wolverhampton
