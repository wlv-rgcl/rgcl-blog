The **European Master’s in Technology for Translation and Interpreting (EM TTI)**
addresses the need for a new generation of translators and interpreters through
a programme of outstanding academic quality, in line with the Erasmus+ ethos of
building a stronger workforce with the breadth of skills and perspectives
needed to stimulate developments in the field. RGCL is proud to run the
coordination of EM TTI on behalf of the University of Wolverhampton.

The programme is funded by the Erasmus+ programme and is made up of a strong
consortium of the [University of Wolverhampton, UK](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/)
(Coordinator); [University of Malaga,
Spain](https://www.uma.es/?set_language=en); [New Bulgarian University,
Bulgaria](https://www.nbu.bg/en) and [Ghent University,
Belgium](https://www.ugent.be/en). This is complemented by a network of
Associate Partners, made up of leading companies, user organisations and non-EC
universities. This combination ensures that EM TTI delivers both educational
quality and vocational skills to maximise the student’s career potential. The
Consortium were awarded €3 million to welcome four cohorts of scholarship
holders to the two-year master’s programme.

Professor Ruslan Mitkov (Head of RGCL, Director of RIILP and Co-ordinator of EM TTI) explains:

> “The amount of text available in electronic format and on the internet is
> growing exponentially, and much of this information has to be translated or
> interpreted. As a result, there is a pressing demand for a new generation of
> translators and interpreters who rely less on traditional methods and instead
> benefit from a range of time- and labour-efficient technological tools. EM
> TTI was set up to address this and meet the needs of the industry.”

The programme involves research-intensive modules and the research being
undertaken across the consortium is used to continually shape the course and
ensure it is state-of-the-art. The dissertation topics are based on realistic
problems and complemented by placements at the Associate Partners which enable
students to use real-life experience as part of their work.

EM TTI produces specialists in translation and interpreting who are up-to-date
with the latest applications, which support their daily work, as well as future
developers of such applications. For instance, we recently hosted EM TTI
Visiting Scholar Will Lewis, formerly of Microsoft, who delivered a week of
fascinating lectures and industry insights to our students.

The consortium embodies the aim to deliver a cohesive, integrated European
programme, which is the first of its kind worldwide. The synergy between these
four Higher Education institutions, who are known for their seminal
contributions to the computational aspects of language study, as well as
technology of translation and interpreting, ensures that students have access
to leading academics and best practices across the field. The Associate
Partners of the programme are leading companies, user organisations, and non-EC
universities who further enhance the student-centred and market-orientated
programme with a vision of delivering educational quality and vocational skills
to maximise the students’ career potential, complementing the quality and
integrity of the programme. Some of the Associate Partners for this programme
include Kudo, Sketch Engine, Transperfect, STAR, Wordfast and cohort one, two
and three students have experienced excellent placements with them so far.

The programme is successfully underway with a number of achievements including
our first cohort of students graduating in 2020/2021, hosting our first
in-person Annual Event and celebrating one of our first success story students,
