A key part of RGCL’s commitment to the wider research community is our ongoing
engagement with, and organising of, international research events. Over the
past 25 years, RGCL has been instrumental in organising dozens of conferences,
symposia, workshops and summer schools, in locations ranging from Varna and
Hissar in Bulgaria, to Malaga, London, Luxembourg, and Rhodes, drawing some of
the world’s best scholars and practitioners in Computational Linguistics,
Natural Language Processing, Corpus Linguistics, and Translation Technology.

*Some of the conferences that RGCL has helped to organise and run*

Most recently, we have co-organised the conference of *New Trends in Translation
and Technology* (NeTTT 2022), including its Summer School in Neural Machine
Translation; and the Quality Estimation shared task as part of the *Conference
on Machine Translation* (WMT'22). Coming up very soon is the next instalment of
the biennial Europhras conference, *Computational and Corpus-based Phraseology*
(September 2022 in Malaga).
