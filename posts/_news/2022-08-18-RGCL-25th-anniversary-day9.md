It all began with a paper entitled “[Computer-aided generation of
multiple-choice tests](https://aclanthology.org/W03-0203.pdf)” at the very first [BEA (Building educational applications
using Natural Language Processing) workshop](https://sig-edu.org/bea/2022) in Edmonton, Canada, 2003 (19 years
ago; this year, the workshop is in its 17th edition).

The paper describes a novel computer-aided procedure for generating
multiple-choice tests from electronic instructional documents. The
then-Director of the Center for Innovation at the National Board of Medical
Examiners (NBME) read the paper, and arranged a meeting with RGCL team in
Wolverhampton. They asked us to run the system on a medical text. They then got
the results, and analysed them on their way back to Philadelphia. The rest, as
they say, is history.

A fruitful collaboration was established. Various problems such as [translation
from American to British English](https://www.academia.edu/download/51268874/Collaboration_across_the_pond_The_multi-20170109-9421-o7hnk.pdf), information extraction from test items,
[predicting response times and items difficulties](https://wlv.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/2436/624379/Yaneva_et_al_Using_linguistic_features_2021.pdf), [patient note scoring](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nbme-score-clinical-patient-notes), and
[short answer scoring](https://wlv.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/2436/623828/2020.coling-main.77.pdf) have been studied together, between RGCL and NBME. The
collaboration officially started back in 2005 (17 years ago) and is still
ongoing. An impact case study based on this collaboration was detailed and
returned to the REF2021 exercise.

Through this collaboration, a few quotations of urban-legend status – such as
an RGCL staff member being able to “walk on water”, or “Wolverhampton is
well-known for two things: the industrial revolution, and its Research Group in
Computational Linguistics” – have been born. 

RGCL is indebted to Le An Ha for his continuous excellent work on the NBME
project, and to Victoria Yaneva, whose work for NBME was evidently so
impressive as to land her a job there as Senior Data Scientist!
