Computational Linguistics is not traditionally associated with women, but in
our case, it is. Over the years, RGCL has attracted, hosted, trained and
supported dozens of talented women, and in this post we’d like to celebrate
their journeys and achievements.

### Current women of RGCL
<img style="float: right; margin:30px 30px 30px 30px" src="{{ site_url | relative_url }}/medias/2022-09-07-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day23_pict1.jpg">
Beginning with our current and most senior women members, we are honoured to
have **Prof Gloria Corpas Pastor** as a Visiting Professor at RGCL. She is also
Professor of Translation and Interpreting of the University of Malaga, Spain,
and Head of the Research Group in Lexicography and Translation (Lexytrad). Prof
Corpas Pastor has published a wide collection of papers in both national and
international journals, and is author and editor of several books. She is
regularly invited to give talks at international events and is a member of
several Editorial Boards and Scientific Committees. She has won several
important awards, including the 2007 "Translation Technologies Award" given by
the Spanish Research Network on Translation Technologies, and the 2017 "Farola
Award" in the field of New Technologies, given by the Andalusian Women's
Institute, Junta de Andalucía.  Her seminal contributions to the areas of
corpus-based translation, computational phraseology, and technology for
translation and interpretation have inspired generations of researchers both in
Spain and abroad. This year, Prof Corpas Pastor was awarded the Saint Francis
Prize in Techno-Humanities in recognition of her significant achievements in
translation technology.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Next, our Deputy Head of the Group, **Dr Burcu Can**, is currently a Reader in
Computational Linguistics. She has been working in academia for 17 years, with
expertise in various fields in computational linguistics and natural language
processing. She was involved in several projects, received a project
performance award for a project that she was leading, published more than 30
conference papers and more than 10 journal papers in the top conferences and
journals in the field of natural language processing. She is currently the
Associate Editor of the Journal of Natural Language Engineering along with
being an editorial board member in several other journals.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
For many years now, we have had the privilege of working with **Dr Sara Moze**, a
Lecturer in Computational Lexicology at RGCL. Dr Moze joined us as a Research
Associate in 2014 on the *Disambiguation of Verbs by Collocation* project, and
was instrumental in the creation of the [Pattern Dictionary of English Verbs](https://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/news/2022-08-15-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day6/).
Sara is now the Co-Head of Teaching in RGCL, as well as Local Coordinator for
the European Master's in Technology for Translation and Interpreting (EM TTI)
and Course Leader for the MA in Practical Corpus Linguistics for ELT,
Lexicography, and Translation (MA CorLing). She regularly serves on programme
committees for international conferences in lexicography and NLP (e.g. eLex,
EUROPHRAS, EURALEX, and the DiscoNLP workshop at NAACL HLT). Sara has also
participated in Advance HE's prestigious [Aurora Leadership programme for women](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/programmes-events/aurora)
(2017-18).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
**Dr Emma Franklin** joined us as a wee undergraduate intern in 2011, and we
haven’t been able to shake her off since. Having completed her undergraduate
studies in English Language and Linguistics (University of Wolverhampton), her
MRes in Corpus Linguistics (University of Birmingham), and her PhD in Corpus
Linguistics (Lancaster University) on a competitive AHRC scholarship, all while
working part-time at RGCL, Emma then undertook a postdoctoral research position
at the University of Sheffield and returned to us a year later as a Lecturer in
Corpus-based Digital Humanities. Emma has worked on a range of corpus and
computational linguistic projects with us, from syntactic and coreferential
annotation and corpus lexicography to long-term editorial assistance on the
[Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics](https://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/news/2022-09-05-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day21/). Emma has acted as reviewer for a
number of computational linguistic conferences, and has reviewed books,
chapters and papers for *Bloomsbury Advances in Ecolinguistics*; *Corpora*;
*Discourse and Communication; Discourse, Context & Media*; and *Natural Language
Processing*.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Our administrative team – officially [award-winning](https://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/news/2022-08-12-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day5/)! – is led by the excellent
**Dr Amanda Bloore**. Before coming to RGCL, Amanda completed her PhD in
Broadcasting and then undertook a postdoctoral research position at the
University of Worcester. Amanda, who is currently Operations Manager for RIILP,
said: 
> “I started at RGCL as a maternity cover for April Harper - I had three days
> to learn everything before April went off! It was a whirlwind few days, but
> we managed. I really enjoyed working within RGCL and was delighted when a
> permanent post became available before my contract ended. I’ve worked my way
> through the jobs in the admin team, starting as Research Assistant and PA,
> before becoming the Project and Funding officer and finally the Operations
> Manager.”

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Suman Hira** came to RGCL on a maternity leave cover contract in 2019, but she
has been too good to lose and her contract has been extended and re-extended
multiple times since! Suman has worked as a PA for Prof Mitkov, has been a
Research Administrator for RGCL, and also works on the EM TTI administration
team. Suman and Amanda, as well as **Kate Wilson** and **April Harper**, who have both
recently left the Group, were awarded the Vice Chancellor’s Staff Excellence
Award in 2021. Kate and April were both stalwarts of the Group, and we miss
them hugely!

Finally, we are so thrilled to have our fantastic women PhD students, **Maria**, **Rocío**, **Sandra**, **Hadeel**, **Milena**, **Sonia**, **Isuri**, and **Kanishka**.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
**Rocío**, who is undertaking a PhD in Translation Technologies, said of RGCL: 
> “I am Rocío Caro Quintana and I am currently a PhD student. I studied
> Translation and Interpreting in Malaga and now I am doing my PhD in Translation
> Technologies. I am also working at JNLE and helping with the organisation of
> a few conferences like NeTTT or RANLP. I am very thankful to all the women
> that have been part of RGCL for helping me and creating a space where we feel
> included.”

<p>&nbsp;</p>
**Maria**, when asked about her experiences at RGCL, shared:
> I joined RGCL in January 2019 as a PhD Student. When I was looking for PhD
> programmes, I was immediately attracted by this position, because I
> recognised the group. I was already familiar with some of the research
> published by the RGCL members. Reading more about the RGCL strengthened my
> belief that it was a strong and diverse research community. I was very proud
> to become part of it. Now, as I am getting very close to the end of my
> studies, it is difficult to overestimate the role the RGCL played in my
> development as a computational linguist. It is not only the ample
> opportunities to get involved with world-level research and communities,
> meeting the computational linguistics legends and drawing inspirations from
> the many brilliant former students. It is also acquiring insider's
> understanding of important components of research activities such as
> organising top conferences and running a successful journal in the field. I
> have my doubts that I would have an opportunity to be exposed to all these
> aspects if I selected a different place to do my PhD. I also felt very
> welcome without being too regulated: a perfect balance between being engaged
> and independent. I remain very grateful to April Harper and Shiva
> Taslimipoor, the two women in the RGCL who helped me to onboard.”

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Maria Carmela (**Milena**), another of our PhD students, has added:
> “I studied Digital Humanities at the University of Pisa and came to RGCL as a
> trainee to prepare my master thesis under the Erasmus+ Programme. During this
> time, I had the opportunity to improve my coding skills, challenge my
> knowledge in NLP and meet inspiring people from all around the world! I was
> so enthusiastic about this experience that I decided to apply for the PhD
> Programme in Computational Linguistics and I came back as a PhD student in
> 2021. My research interests lie at the intersection between Computer Vision
> and NLP. I helped organising TRITON and RANLP'21. I work as editorial
> assistant for the Journal of Natural Language Engineering.”

### Past women of RGCL

There are almost too many to name, but we would like to pay tribute to some of
the amazing women who have paved the way for those of us currently in the
Group.

<img style="float: left; margin:30px 30px 30px 30px" src="{{ site_url | relative_url }}/medias/2022-09-07-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day23_pict10.jpg">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
**Alison Carminke** worked as an Administrative Funding Manager in RIILP from 2008
to 2012. During that time, she gained her first experience in European funding
streams such as FP7 and the Lifelong Learning programme, as well as in national
funding streams such as JISC and AHRC. Moving within the University of
Wolverhampton to the International Academy and the Faculty of Arts, Business
and Social Sciences, Alison leveraged her early training in RIILP to become an
expert in bidding and project management. In particular, she is recognised for
her knowledge of Erasmus+ strategic partnerships, with a 100% success rate in
her last five proposals submitted to the UK National Agency.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Other fantastic former admin team members are **Erin Stokes**, **Helen Williams**, and **Stephanie Kyle**, to name just a few.

Then there are our former PhD students and staff members: **Laura Hasler**,
**Georgiana Marsic**, **Sanja Stajner**, **Victoria Yaneva**, **Lucia Specia**,
**Luz Rello**, **Irina Temnikova**, **Natalia Konstantinova**, **Natalia
(Natasha) Ponomareva**, **Miranda Chong**, **Andrea Varga**, **Vinita Nahar**,
**Catalina Barbu**, **Yvonne Skalban**, **Jane Bradbury**, **Shiva
Taslimipoor**, **Najah Albaqawi**, and **Hanna Bechara**, amongst others, all
of whom have excelled in their fields and are a credit to the Group.

<img style="float: right; margin:30px 30px 30px 30px" src="{{ site_url | relative_url }}/medias/2022-09-07-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day23_pict11.jpg">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
**Victoria Yaneva** was originally a Master's student at the University of Plovdiv and, in
November 2011, when Prof Mitkov was receiving his first Doctor Honoris Causa
award there, he sought to recruit a Master's student with knowledge of
Psychology and fluency in Bulgarian to complete coreference annotation for the
[FIRST project](https://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/news/2022-08-10-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day3/). Victoria was the clear winner at the interviews, and after two
months of work at RGCL, she had impressed the project leads to such an extent
that she was offered a PhD studentship with the Group. 
After her PhD, she went to be an early-career researcher, and finally a
lecturer with us. Here is what she said:
> “It was inspiring to see so many women at RGCL who excel in a traditionally
> male-dominated area. Their example and support has been crucial for the
> success of many PhD students and early career researchers.” 

Victoria’s work was covered by [ITV
news](https://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/news/2022-08-11-RGCL-25th-anniversary-day4/) while
she was at RGCL, and Victoria is now Senior Data Scientist at the National
Board of Medical Examiners in the US.
