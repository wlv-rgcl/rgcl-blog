We are working with BBC Arts and Faculty of Arts on a new engagement project to mark the 300th anniversary of the English Language Novel.

The interdisciplinary project unites research by Wolverhampton’s Research Group for Computational Linguistics, including Dr Sara Moze, Richard Evans and Dr Emad Mohamed, and from English and Creative Writing staff, led by Dr Aidan Byrne. The project is seeking support from the Arts and Humanities Research Council.

There is more information on the University website if you would like to find out more about the project: <https://www.wlv.ac.uk/about-us/news-and-events/latest-news/2019/august-2019/wolverhampton-researchers-collaborate-on-bbcs-novels-that-shaped-our-world.php>.
