Almost 25 years ago – around the time that RGCL was established – the Head of
the Group, Prof Ruslan Mitkov, embarked on another very ambitious project. He
had received an invitation from John Davey at Oxford University Press to submit
a proposal for an *Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics*, and in June
1998, his proposal was accepted. It wasn’t until 2002 that all of the
contributors’ proofs were received and finalised, leading to a hardback
publication in 2003. A paperback version was published in 2005.

*The cover of the first edition of the Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics*

This first edition of the Handbook contained 38 chapters, commissioned from
experts all over the world, describing major concepts, processes, methods, and
applications in computational linguistics. Part I, *Linguistic Fundamentals*,
provided an overview of the field suitable for senior undergraduates and
non-specialists from other fields of linguistics and related disciplines. Part
II described current tasks, techniques, and tools in Natural Language
Processing and aimed to meet the needs of post-doctoral workers and others
embarking on computational language research, while Part III surveyed current
applications.

*The Handbook contained three parts, and featured such influential scholars as
Ronald Kaplan, Patrick Hanks, Geoffrey Leech, Harold Somers and Ed Hovy, to
name a few*

The book was then a state-of-the-art reference to the one of the most active
and productive fields in linguistics, which, as we know, has only continued to
grow exponentially. It received favourable reviews from a range of users, from
students and scholars to NLP practitioners. Peter Jackson, then vice-president
of Thomson Legal & Regulatory, described the Handbook as “an impressive volume
that demonstrates just how far the ﬁeld has progressed in the last decade.”
Other reviewers have described it as “comprehensive”, “excellent” and “well
written”, a “recent review of the whole field”. It became a major and
influential publication in the field of Computational Linguistics, and in 2011
a Chinese edition was produced.

John Davey, who sadly died in 2017, hailed the volume as OUP’s most successful
handbook of all time.
