In a recent message of support from [Professor Ed Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/) -- a highly respected figure in the Computational Linguistics community – we were reminded that RGCL "has a very strong record of turning out people as well as ideas". 
One such success is our former PhD student Victoria Yaneva, who went on to work with us as a postdoctoral researcher and then a lecturer, and is now Senior Data Scientist at the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) in the US.

During her time at RGCL, Dr Yaneva’s research into text accessibility for people with autism generated a great deal of interest and positive attention, perhaps most notably when ITV news came to the RGCL offices to interview Victoria about her work involving an eye-tracker:

Since then, Victoria has gone on to give a TEDx talk via TEDxBrum about the need for access to meaning:

And her work has appeared in a range of other news venues, including the Chronicle, social care news platform Care Appointments, and Bulgarian television:

Dr Yaneva continues to play an active role in accessibility research, while also working on improving medical exams using NLP and behavioural data for NBME in the US. 
She is also co-editor of the forthcoming volume on NLP in Assessment with Matthias von Davier.  
A list of Victoria’s awards to date can be found [here](https://www.victoriayaneva.info/index.phpi/about-me/).  

RGCL is very proud to have such excellent former students and staff members!
