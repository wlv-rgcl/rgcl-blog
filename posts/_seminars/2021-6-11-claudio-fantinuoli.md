### Abstract

Interpretation is at the verge of a third technical revolution. This will bring about a deeper integration of technology in the interpreter workstation. Artificial Intelligence is becoming integral part of computer-assisted interpreting (CAI) tools and is now allowing machine learning to enter the workflow of professional interpreters. CAI tools can create ad-hoc linguistic resources, suggest in real-time translations, numbers and proper names and automatize several aspects around the service provision. In this presentation I will discuss the promise of AI for the interpreting profession, its potentials and risks.
