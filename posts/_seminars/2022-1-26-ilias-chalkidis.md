### Abstract
Law is one of the cornerstones of our civilisation. The legal industry produces constantly large volumes of legal text in various forms, i.e, legislation, court decisions, and legal agreements (contracts). Hence, consuming and understanding legal information can be overwhelming, as the points of interest for users (legal professionals and laypersons) are hidden in piles of pages and documents. Legal Text Processing (a.k.a. Legal NLP or Intelligence) is a growing research area where Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied in the legal domain. In this talk, I will first point out the main challenges of legal NLP and how the field is advancing. In this regard, I will first argue on the importance of proper benchmarking, and the development of legal-oriented language models. Then I will cover parts of my recent work on large-scale classification under temporal drift, and “baby” steps for cross-lingual legal NLP, decision explainability, robustness, and fairness.

>What the blockchain will do especially in its NFT form on top of Ethereum is create a world that will eat up all of the contracts. Every contract in the next 15 years will be done on the blockchain.
