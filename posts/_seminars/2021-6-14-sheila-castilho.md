### Abstract

Document-level human evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) has been raising interest in the community. However, little is known about the issues of using document-level methodologies to assess MT quality. This presentation will explore what has been done so far in document-level human MT evaluation, touching the issues of inter-annotator agreement, effort and misevaluation.
