### Abstract

Interpreters, as well as translators, need to be familiar with all the skills and abilities necessary to create a terminological project and detect the terminology belonging to specific domains of the orality genre.
The typical approach for detecting specialized terminology can be described through a workflow which combines different stages, starting from an information mining stage and ending with the creation of a terminological resource, namely a glossary or a terminology database that, when needed, can also be combined with Computer Assisted Translation tools.
The workflow presented in this talk starts with the definition of a domain and with the collection of reference materials on the Internet. The second step consists in the construction of specialized comparable corpora from the web using a dedicated tool. The third stage is the corpus-based extraction of simple or complex terms with the help of a concordancing tool. The last step of the workflow is the creation of terminological entries organized in the form of glossaries and/or TermBases.
The insights gained from this presentation will help trainee and professional interpreters prepare terminological resources both for specific assignments and for more general topics.
