### Abstract

Phraseology and Corpus-based Phraseology have lately been regarded as relevant fields to Translation and Interpreting Studies (Corpas Pastor & Mitkov 2019; Colson 2020 etc.), playing a key role in the translation process of phraseological units, especially collocations. Collocations are pervasive and recurrent combinations and so are found in all types of written or oral texts or discourses. Besides that, they pose a great difficulty for translators and interpreters, mainly for the student or novice ones. Even though they are easily decoded, encoding and translating collocations seem to be a much more complex process. Hence, proposing a more suitable, idiomatic and natural equivalent in the target text may be a challenging task.

 

Corpus-based Phraseography, in its turn, responsible for the compilation of dictionaries and glossaries of phraseological units, is another field of knowledge that has contributed to the area of Translation and Interpreting in the past few years. Anyhow, there is still a gap that should be filled, considering that most bilingual or multilingual lexicographical or phraseographical works still overlook the specific needs of student or professional translators and interpreters.

 

In this talk, we will discuss the relevance and contributions of Corpus-based Phraseology and Phraseography to Translation and Interpreting Studies. We will also address the development of a phraseographical methodology and model for an Online Corpus-Based Multilingual Collocations Dictionary Platform" (FAPESP Process 2020/01783-2), targeting at translators and interpreters who work with English, Portuguese, Spanish, French and Chinese languages (Orenha-Ottaiano et al 2021; Orenha-Ottaiano & Olímpio de Oliveira 2021). Taking into account the specificities of the translation practice, the Platform has the aim of increasing student and professional translators’ collocational and phraseological competence as well as meeting their needs in what regards the translation of collocations. The project has the goal of developing a user-friendly and highly informative end-user platform, based on the contributions from the Function Theory of Lexicography (Fuertes Olivera & Tarp 2014; Tarp 2015; Bergenholtz & Tarp 2003).
