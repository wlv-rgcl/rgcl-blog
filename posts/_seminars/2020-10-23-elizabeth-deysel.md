### Abstract

The webinar starts with a brief introduction on the history of technology and interpreting. It then provides a broad overview on technology and interpreting and what tools are currently available and used most frequently in practice. The two types of technologies to be discussed are: 1) process orientated technologies which provides support to the interpreter and 2) setting orientated technologies which shape and change the way interpreting is delivered.
