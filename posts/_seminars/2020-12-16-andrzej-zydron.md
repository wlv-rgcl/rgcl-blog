### Abstract

AI gets a lot of attention generally due to the stunning results that can be achieved, in fields such as medicine, automotive technology, diagnostic systems and of course translation. AI systems can seemingly outperform human beings in a wide range of tasks, from playing Chess, Go or even poker, to face and voice recognition. What is often lacking though, is a more realistic understanding of what intelligence is and the actual limitations that exist given the computing tools at our disposal.
 
The reality is much more prosaic: most of the mathematical basis of what is termed AI is not complicated and generally rooted in early 18th century mathematics, namely work done by Euler and Bayes.
 
Although some of the achievements of AI based systems may seem phenomenal, they are achieved through processing of gigantic amounts of data which would normally be beyond human capability. The presentation looks at what actually constitutes AI and how it relates to general human intelligence and what implications this has for the translation industry in general
