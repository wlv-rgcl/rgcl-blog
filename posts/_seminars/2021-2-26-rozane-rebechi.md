### Abstract

This talk attempts to share findings of research I have carried out for the past years involving English-Portuguese translation of cultural references. Much has been discussed about the difficulties to translate culture-related elements, after all, “[t]he worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels” (Sapir, 1949: 162). However, semiautomatic investigation of simple and compound keywords retrieved from (small) comparable corpora demonstrate that functional translation (Nord, 2006) of texts of a similar genre in different languages and cultures go far beyond linguistic equivalence, as the specificities of the genre in both languages and cultures should also be considered by translators. To produce texts that work properly for the target reader, the translator should be aware of the domain conventions in both languages and cultures before deciding what aspects should be maintained, adapted, or omitted. Using examples resulting from the analysis of obituaries, cooking recipes, and restaurant reviews (Rebechi, 2018, 2020, 2021), the presentation seeks to demonstrate that the assumptions underlying corpus linguistics may not only help translators to interpret the source language texts, but also assist them in finding solutions for the translation process (Stewart, 2000).
