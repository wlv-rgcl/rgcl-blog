### Abstract

In this talk we will address the challenges of digital transformation in the Cultural Heritage sector, starting from the example of digitizing photographic collections for Europeana. We will discuss how, starting from the actual digitization process of selected collections, a series of workflow transitions is inevitably set in motion that has a transformational impact, not only  on the way GLAM institutions operate, but how they rethink their core mission and their fundamental relationship with their audiences. We will highlight both technical as well as organizational and management challenges, and how this reveals the place and contribution of digital humanities research.
