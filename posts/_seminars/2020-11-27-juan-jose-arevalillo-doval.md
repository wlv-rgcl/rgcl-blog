### Abstract

Quality in the language services industry is a very blurred term, but omnipresent in all activities from the moment a customer requests a translation service to the delivery and final closing of the project. In this process everything is measured and compliance with all requirements is usually a guarantee of success with the customer. In addition, there are numerous quality standards under ISO’s umbrella covering different services and aspects in this industry, which are applied on a daily basis and also form the basis of numerous academic programmes. Knowing this environment is essential for the future professionals so that they can know where they fit into the process and how to behave and act in that process.
