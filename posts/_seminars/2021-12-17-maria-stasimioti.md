### Abstract

he working environment of translators has changed significantly in recent decades, with post-editing (PE) emerging as a new trend in the human translation workflow, particularly following the advent of neural machine translation (NMT) and the improvement of the quality of the machine translation (MT) raw output especially at the level of fluency. Despite the productivity gains associated with it, PE raises several questions on the cognitive load exerted on translators, as well as on the quality of the final product. The focus of this presentation will be on the cognitive, temporal, and technical effort expended by translators for the full PE of NMT output in L1 (Greek), on the one hand, and the cognitive, temporal, and technical effort expended by translators for the full PE of NMT output in L2 (English), on the other hand, by means of eye-tracking and keystroke logging data, as well as on the quality of the final product. Moreover, the analysis bears on direct as well as inverse PE in an effort to establish whether the directionality axiom holds true in the case of PE.
