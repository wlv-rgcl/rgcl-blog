### Abstract

Matching and retrieving previously translated segments from a Translation Memory is the key functionality in Translation Memories systems. However, this matching and retrieving process is still limited to algorithms based on edit distance which we have identified as a major drawback in Translation Memories systems. In this talk, we talk about our research [1,2] on sentence encoders to improve the matching and retrieving process in Translation Memories systems - an effective and efficient solution to replace edit distance-based algorithms.
