### Abstract

The lack of consideration of interpreters’ (and translators’) needs in the design of new technological tools has been a major concern of professionals in the T&I industry. This concern has been at the heart of SmarTerp — the remote simultaneous interpreting (RSI) platform powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Thanks to the research efforts of an interdisciplinary team, interpreters’ needs and requirements were incorporated into all stages of SmarTerp’s iterative design and development. This talk presents this cutting-edge technology and sheds light into how research made its interpreter-centred development possible. It will conclude with some reflections on the role of research in the increasing technologisation of the interpreting profession.

### Speaker's bio

Francesca Maria Frittella is a conference interpreter (ITA A - ENG B - DEU B - ZHO C), trainer and researcher. She conducted user research and developed training solutions within the SmarTerp project to inform its development into an interpreter-centred solution. Her PhD research at Shanghai International Studies University focuses on the training of conference interpreters on how to effectively integrate AI-powered computer-assisted interpreting (CAI) tools into the SI process. Co-founder of Interpremy, Francesca develops e-courses and teaches research-based workshops for interpreting universities and professional associations.
