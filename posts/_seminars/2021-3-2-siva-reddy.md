### Abstract

Large neural models of language have achieved state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks like Question Answering. Despite this progress, they are known to be surprisingly brittle to variations of input. In this talk, we will systematically study the pathological behaviours of neural models in three scenarios: generalization to natural language sentence structure, generalization in reasoning strategies, and latent capture of societal biases.
