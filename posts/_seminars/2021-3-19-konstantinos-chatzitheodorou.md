### Abstract

The process of determining translation quality is subjective and relies on human judgments. Translation quality is affected by a variety of factors that are weighted differently in each translation task and can be viewed from different perspectives. Hence, it is not equally measurable or assessable (Almutairi, 2018). The talk will emphasize the importance of measuring translation quality and how it can be accomplished. The first part of the presentation will introduce different frameworks and software used in the process of translation evaluation focusing on error classification schemes available in both professional and academic word. The second part of the presentation will include a demonstration of Træval which is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that allows humans to evaluate translation outputs. By providing an easy-to-use graphical interface, it assists researchers and users in this process. In particular, three different scenarios will be presented using the Dynamic Quality Framework - Multidimensional Quality Metrics (DQF-MQM) error typology (Lommel, 2018): an evaluation of a simple translation task, an evaluation task focused on the assessment of multi-word units, and, finally, a technology-aided evaluation task aiming to reduce subjectivity.
